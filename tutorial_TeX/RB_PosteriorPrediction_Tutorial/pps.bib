  abstract    = "Two approximate methods are proposed for maximum likelihood
                 phylogenetic estimation, which allow variable rates of
                 substitution across nucleotide sites. Three data sets with
                 quite different characteristics were analyzed to examine
                 empirically the performance of these methods. The first,
                 called the ``discrete gamma model,'' uses several categories
                 of rates to approximate the gamma distribution, with equal
                 probability for each category. The mean of each category is
                 used to represent all the rates falling in the category. The
                 performance of this method is found to be quite good, and four
                 such categories appear to be sufficient to produce both an
                 optimum, or near-optimum fit by the model to the data, and
                 also an acceptable approximation to the continuous
                 distribution. The second method, called ``fixed-rates model'',
                 classifies sites into several classes according to their rates
                 predicted assuming the star tree. Sites in different classes
                 are then assumed to be evolving at these fixed rates when
                 other tree topologies are evaluated. Analyses of the data sets
                 suggest that this method can produce reasonable results, but
                 it seems to share some properties of a least-squares pairwise
                 comparison; for example, interior branch lengths in nonbest
                 trees are often found to be zero. The computational
                 requirements of the two methods are comparable to that of
                 Felsenstein's (1981, J Mol Evol 17:368-376) model, which
                 assumes a single rate for all the sites.",

  abstract = "A new statistical method for estimating divergence dates of
              species from DNA sequence data by a molecular clock approach is
              developed. This method takes into account effectively the
              information contained in a set of DNA sequence data. The
              molecular clock of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was calibrated by
              setting the date of divergence between primates and ungulates at
              the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (65 million years ago), when the
              extinction of dinosaurs occurred. A generalized least-squares
              method was applied in fitting a model to mtDNA sequence data, and
              the clock gave dates of 92.3 +/- 11.7, 13.3 +/- 1.5, 10.9 +/-
              1.2, 3.7 +/- 0.6, and 2.7 +/- 0.6 million years ago (where the
              second of each pair of numbers is the standard deviation) for the
              separation of mouse, gibbon, orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee,
              respectively, from the line leading to humans. Although there is
              some uncertainty in the clock, this dating may pose a problem for
              the widely believed hypothesis that the pipedal creature
              Australopithecus afarensis, which lived some 3.7 million years
              ago at Laetoli in Tanzania and at Hadar in Ethiopia, was
              ancestral to man and evolved after the human-ape splitting.
              Another likelier possibility is that mtDNA was transferred
              through hybridization between a proto-human and a
              proto-chimpanzee after the former had developed bipedalism.",

  abstract    = "Topological heterogeneity among gene trees is widely observed
                 in phylogenomic analyses and some of this variation is likely
                 caused by systematic error in gene tree estimation. Systematic
                 error can be mitigated by improving models of sequence
                 evolution to account for all evolutionary processes relevant
                 to each gene or identifying those genes whose evolution best
                 conforms to existing models. However, the best method for
                 identifying such genes is not well established. Here, we ask
                 if filtering genes according to their clock-likeness or
                 posterior predictive effect size (PPES, an inference-based
                 measure of model violation) improves phylogenetic reliability
                 and congruence. We compared these approaches to each other,
                 and to the common practice of filtering based on rate of
                 evolution, using two different metrics. First, we compared
                 gene-tree topologies to accepted reference topologies. Second,
                 we examined topological similarity among gene trees in
                 filtered sets. Our results suggest that filtering genes based
                 on clock-likeness and PPES can yield a collection of genes
                 with more reliable phylogenetic signal. For the two exemplar
                 data sets we explored, from yeast and amniotes, clock-likeness
                 and PPES outperformed rate-based filtering in both congruence
                 and reliability.",

  abstract    = "Systematic phylogenetic error caused by the simplifying
                 assumptions made in models of molecular evolution may be
                 impossible to avoid entirely when attempting to model
                 evolution across massive, diverse data sets. However, not all
                 deficiencies of inference models result in unreliable
                 phylogenetic estimates. The field of phylogenetics lacks a
                 direct method to identify cases where model specification
                 adversely affects inferences. Posterior predictive simulation
                 is a flexible and intuitive approach for assessing
                 goodness-of-fit of the assumed model and priors in a Bayesian
                 phylogenetic analysis. Here, I propose new test statistics for
                 use in posterior predictive assessment of model fit. These
                 test statistics compare phylogenetic inferences from posterior
                 predictive data sets to inferences from the original data. A
                 simulation study demonstrates the utility of these new
                 statistics. The new tests reject the plausibility of inferred
                 tree lengths or topologies more often when data/model
                 combinations produce biased inferences. I also apply this
                 approach to exemplar empirical data sets, highlighting the
                 value of the novel assessments.",
