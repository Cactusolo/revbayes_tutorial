\section*{Introduction}

How did species come to live where they're found today?
To answer this, we can leverage phylogenetic, molecular, and geographical information to model species distributions as the outcome of biogeographic processes.
How to best model these processes requires special consideration, such as how ranges are inherited following speciation events, how geological events might influence dispersal rates, and what factors affect rates of dispersal and extirpation.
The major challenge of modeling range evolution is how to translate these natural processes into stochastic processes that remain tractable for inference.
This tutorial provides a brief background in some of these models, then describes how to perform Bayesian inference of historical biogeography using \RevBayes.
