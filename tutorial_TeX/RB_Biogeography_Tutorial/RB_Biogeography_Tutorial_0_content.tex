\section{Introduction}

How did species come to live where they're found today?
Observing where species live today, we can leverage phylogenetic and geological information to model their distribution as the outcome of biogeographic processes to answer this.
These natural processes require some additional considerations, such as how ranges are inherited following speciation events, and how geological events might influence dispersal rates.
Using \RevBayes~for biogeographic inference, standard Bayesian techniques are available, such as model selection, Metropolis-coupled MCMC, and stochastic mapping.
This tutorial describes how to perform Bayesian inference of historical biogeography using \RevBayes. 
Currently, this primarily covers range evolution models, where a species may occupy multiple discrete areas simultaneously.
Tutorials to model individual specimens' geographical locations (sometimes called phylogeographic models) are under development.

%\subsection{Setting up your workspace}
%
%The practical part of the lab will analyze a small dataset of 19 taxa distributed over 4 biogeographic areas.
%Parts of the lab will require entering terminal commands, which will assume you are using the Unix shell \texttt{bash}.
%Just ask for help if the commands don't seem to work.
%
%\noindent \\ \impmark Portions of this lab require Python is installed. No packages are needed.
%
%\noindent \\ \impmark This tutorial will assume you have successfully installed RevBayes and can be called from your current working directory.
%
%\noindent \\ \impmark Download and unzip the lab zip file, {\tt RB\_biogeo\_files.zip}.
