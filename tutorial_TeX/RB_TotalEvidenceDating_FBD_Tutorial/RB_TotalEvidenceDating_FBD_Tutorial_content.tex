\subsubsection{Morphological Character Change}

The incorporation of morphological data from fossils into phylogenetic analyses allows us to directly observe organisms that existed in the past.
In 2001, Paul Lewis described a model, the Mk model, to allow for the incorporation of morphology into likelihood and Bayesian analyses.
The Mk model uses a generalized Jukes-Cantor matrix.
This introduces a number of assumptions. 
One key assumption is that characters exhibit symmetrical change - that a given character is as likely to transition from a one state to another as it is to reverse.
For example, this assumption applied to a binary character would mean that a change from a 0 state to a 1 state is as likely as a change from a 1 state to a 0 state. \par
In the tutorial, we will relax this assumption through the use of a prior on stationary state frequencies. 
All of the morphological data we are working with in this tutorial are binary.  
Therefore, we can draw the stationary state frequencies of our 0 and 1 characters from a Beta distribution. 
Using the stationary state frequencies drawn from the Beta distribution, we can then create new Q-matrices that allow for asymmetrical change in characters states (i.e., for changing from state 0 to state 1 to be more likely than changing from state 1 to state 0, or vice versa). 
We can do multiple draws from the Beta distribution, creating multiple different Q-matrices per datset.
This allows for heterogeneity in character change asymmetry across the dataset. 
Likewise, we will use the Gamma distributed rate heterogeneity described in (other tutorial) to allow for different characters to evolve at different rates.\par

Because of the way morphological data are collected, we need to exercise caution in how we model the data. 
Traditionally, phylogenetic trees were built from morphological data using parsimony. 
Therefore, characters were collected to be parsimony informative - that is, to be useful for discriminating between phylogenetic hypotheses under the maximum parsimony criterion.
This means that many morphological datasets do not contain invariant characters or autapomorphies, as these cannot be used to discriminate among hypotheses under parsimony. 
By excluding these low rate of evolution characters, the estimated branch lengths can be inflated.
Therefore, it is important to use models that can condition on the coding bias. 
RevBayes has two ways of doing this: one is used for datasets in which only parsimony informative characters are observed; the other is for datasets in which parsimony informative characters and non-parsimony informative variable characters (such as autapomorphies) are observed. \par

\section{Prerequisites}

What do you need to know before doing this?

\subsection{Requirements}
We assume that you have read and hopefully completed the following tutorials:
\begin{itemize}
\item RB\_Getting\_Started
\item RB\_Basics\_Tutorial
\end{itemize}
Note that the RB\_Basics\_Tutorial introduces the basic syntax of \Rev but does not cover any phylogenetic models.
You may skip the RB\_Basics\_Tutorial if you have some familiarity with \R.
We tried to keep this tutorial very basic and introduce all the language concepts on the way.
You may only need the RB\_Basics\_Tutorial for a more in-depth discussion of concepts in \Rev.

\subsection{Data files}\label{subsect:RB-DataFiles}

We provide the data files which we will use in this tutorial.
You may want to use your own data instead.
In the \cl{data} folder, you will find the following files
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item \cl{bears\_taxa.tsv}: a tab-separated table listing every bear species (both fossil and extant) and their occurrence dates. For extant taxa, the occurrence date is \cl{0.0} (\IE the present) and for fossil species, the occurrence date is equal to the mean of the age range (the ranges are defined in a separate file).
\item \cl{bears\_cytb.nex}: an alignment in NEXUS format of 1,000 bp of cytochrome-b sequences for 10 bear species. This alignment includes 8 living bears and 2 extinct sub-fossil bears.
\item \cl{bears\_morphology.nex}: a matrix of 62 discrete, binary (coded \cl{0} or \cl{1}) morphological characters for 18 species of fossil and extant bears.
\item \cl{bears\_fossil\_intervals.tsv}: a tab-separated table containing the age ranges (minimum and maximum in millions of years) for 14 fossil bears.
\end{itemize}


\bigskip
\subsection{Getting Started}\label{subsect:RB-GetStart}

{\begin{framed}
On your own computer, create a directory called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{RB\_TotalEvidenceDating\_FBD\_Tutorial}}} (or any name you like). 

In this directory download and unzip the archive containing the data files: \href{www.revbayes.com}{\cl{data.zip}}.

Additionally, create a new directory (in \cl{RB\_TotalEvidenceDating\_FBD\_Tutorial}) called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{scripts}}}
\end{framed}}

When you execute \RevBayes in this exercise, you will do so within the main directory you created (\cl{RB\_TotalEvidenceDating\_FBD\_Tutorial}).

%TODO Stuff about how to start or Rev basics?

%We will complete this analysis in \RevBayes by entering the \Rev code interactively. 
%
%Note that some PDF viewers render some characters differently and if you copy/paste directly from this document, you may introduce erroneous characters. 
%This can cause commands to fail. 
%For learning, it's often better to `live code' and type the commands in manually, rather than copying and pasting. 
%
%Hints for navigating in the \RevBayes console:
%\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
%    \item \cl{Ctrl+A} -- jump to the beginning of the line
%    \item \cl{Ctrl+E} -- jump to the end of the line
%    \item Pressing the up key will pull up previous commands, and allow you to edit them
%    \item If you enter the first few letters of a \RevBayes keyword and then the \textsc{Tab} key, this will `autocomplete' the remaining letters.
%    \item Help -- if you type \cl{?} followed immediately by a \RevBayes keyword, this will print the help pages for that keyword to the screen. (Example \cl{?dnBDP})
%\end{itemize}
%%In \RevBayes, \cl{Ctrl+A} allows you to jump to the start of the command, if you need to delete extra characters from the front of a line. \cl{Ctrl+E} allows you to jump to the end of a command. Pressing the up key will pull up previous commands, and allow you to edit them. If you do choose to copy and paste in commands, doing that from the tutorial script file will cause fewer errors.

\subsection{Creating \Rev Files}\label{subsect:RB-CreatingFiles}

For complex models and analyses, it is best to create \Rev script files that will contain all of the model parameters, moves, and functions. 
In this exercise, you will work primarily in your text editor and create a set of modular files that will be easily managed and interchanged.
You will write the following files from scratch in a text editor$^*$ and save them in the \cl{scripts} directory:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt]
\item \cl{mcmc\_TEFBD.Rev}: the master \Rev file that loads the data, the separate model files, and specifies the monitors and MCMC sampler.
\item \cl{model\_FBDP\_TEFBD.Rev}: specifies the model parameters and moves required for the fossilized birth-death prior on the tree topology, divergence times, fossil occurrence times, and diversification dynamics.
\item \cl{model\_UCExp\_TEFBD.Rev}: specifies the components of the uncorrelated exponential model of lineage-specific substitution rate variation.
\item \cl{model\_GTRG\_TEFBD.Rev}: specifies the parameters and moves for the general-time reversible model of sequence evolution with gamma-distributed rates across sites (GTR+$\Gamma$).
\item \cl{model\_Morph\_TEFBD.Rev}: specifies the model describing discrete morphological character change (binary characters) under a strict morphological clock. 
\end{itemize}
{\footnotesize $^*$Note: if you do not already have a good text editor that you like, we recommend one that has features for syntax coloring, easy navigation between different files, line numbers, etc.
A good option is \href{http://www.sublimetext.com/}{Sublime Text}, which is available for Mac OSX, Windows, and Linux.}

All of the files that you will create are also provided in the \RevBayes tutorial repository. 
Please refer to these files to verify or troubleshoot your own scripts. 
%TODO add link to scripts


\bigskip
\subsection{Start the Master \Rev File and Import Data}\label{subsect:RB-StartMasterRev}



{\begin{framed}
Open your text editor and create the master \Rev file called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{mcmc\_TEFBD.Rev}}} in the \cl{scripts} directory.

Enter the \Rev code provided in this section in the new model file.
\end{framed}}

The file you will begin in this section will be the one you load into \RevBayes when you've completed all of the components of the analysis.
In this section you will begin the file and write the \Rev commands for loading in the taxon list and managing the data matrices.
Then, starting in Section \ref{subsect:RB-ModelFBD}, you will move on to writing modular files for each of the model components. 
Once the model files are complete, you will return to editing \cl{mcmc\_TEFBD.Rev} and complete the \Rev script with the instructions given in Section \ref{subsect:RB-CompleteMCMC}.

\medskip
\subsubsection{Load Taxon List}\label{subsub:RB-TaxList}

Begin the \Rev script by loading in the list of taxon names from the \cl{bears\_taxa.tsv} file using the \cl{readTaxonData()} function.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
taxa <- readTaxonData("data/bears_taxa.tsv", delimiter=TAB)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}
This function reads the tab-delimited file and creates a variable called \cl{taxa} that is a list of all of the taxon names relevant to this analysis. 
This list includes all of the fossil and extant bears.



\medskip
\subsubsection{Load Data Matrices}\label{subsub:RB-LoadData}

\RevBayes uses the function \cl{readDiscreteCharacterData()} to load a data matrix to the workspace from a formatted file. 
This function can be used for both molecular sequences and discrete morphological characters.

Load the cytochrome-b sequences from file and assign the data matrix to a variable called \cl{cytb}.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
cytb <- readDiscreteCharacterData("data/bears_cytb.nex") 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Next, import the morphological character matrix and assign it to the variable \cl{morpho}. 
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
morpho <- readDiscreteCharacterData("data/bears_morphology.nex")
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

 

\medskip
\subsubsection{Add Missing Taxa}\label{subsub:RB-AddMissing}

In the descriptions of the files in Section \ref{subsect:RB-DataFiles}, we mentioned that the two data matrices have different numbers of taxa. 
Thus, we must add any taxa that are not found in the molecular (\cl{cytb}) partition (\IE are only found in the fossil data) to that data matrix as missing data, and do the same with the morphological data partition (\cl{morpho}).
In order for all the taxa to appear on the same tree, they all need to be part of the same dataset, as opposed to present in separate datasets. 
This ensures that there is a unified taxon set that contains all of our tips.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
cytb.addMissingTaxa( taxa )
morpho.addMissingTaxa( taxa )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}


\medskip
\subsubsection{Create Helper Variables}\label{subsub:RB-mviVar}

Before we begin writing the \Rev scripts for each of the model components, we need to instantiate a couple ``helper variables'' that will be used by downstream parts of our model specification files. 
These variables will be used in more than one of the module files so it's best to initialize them in the master file.

Create a new constant node called \cl{n\_taxa} that is equal to the number of species in our analysis (22). 
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
n_taxa <- taxa.size() 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Next, create a \textit{workspace variable} called \cl{mvi}. 
This variable is an iterator that will build a vector containing all of the MCMC moves used to propose new states for every stochastic node in the model graph. 
After each time a new move is added to the vector, \cl{mvi} will be incremented by a value of \cl{1}.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
mvi = 1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}
One important distinction here is that \cl{mvi} is part of the \RevBayes workspace and not the hierarchical model. 
Thus, we use the \cl{=} operator instead of the \cl{<-} operator. 

{\begin{framed}
Save your current working of \cl{model\_FBDP\_TEFBD.Rev} in the \cl{scripts} directory.

We will now move on to the next \Rev file and will complete \cl{model\_FBDP\_TEFBD.Rev} in Section \ref{subsect:RB-CompleteMCMC}.
\end{framed}}


\bigskip
\subsection{The Fossilized Birth-Death Process}\label{subsect:RB-ModelFBD}

{\begin{framed}
Open your text editor and create the fossilized birth-death model file called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{model\_FBDP\_TEFBD.Rev}}} in the \cl{scripts} directory.

Enter the \Rev code provided in this section in the new model file.
\end{framed}}

Two key parameters of the FBD process are the birth rate (the rate at which lineages are added to the tree) and the death rate (the rate at which lineages are removed from the tree). 
We'll place exponential priors on both of these values. 
An exponential prior with a $\lambda$ =  10 places a higher probability on values closer to zero than one for these parameters. 

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
birth_rate ~ dnExponential(10)
death_rate ~ dnExponential(10)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Now that the priors have been specified, we give RevBayes some information on how to sample values for our parameters. 
We'll use a scaling move, which changes the value sampled multiplicatively with the tuning parameter. 
We will use three different tuning parameters, which govern the size of the move. 
Including multiple tuning parameters improves mixing. 

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(birth_rate, lambda=0.01, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(birth_rate, lambda=0.1, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(birth_rate, lambda=1.0, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(death_rate, delta=0.01, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(death_rate, delta=0.1, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(death_rate, delta=1, weight=3.0)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

In order to print the states of model variables output files (also called \textit{monitoring}), we need to create deterministic nodes for the diversification and turnover. 
Deterministic nodes are value transformations between existing stochastic nodes. 
So we will define diversification and turnover as deterministic nodes.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
diversification := birth_rate - death_rate
turnover := death_rate/birth_rate
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

All extant bears are represented in this dataset. 
Therefore, we can fix the sampling probability of extant lineages to 1.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
rho <- 1.0
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

The rate of sampling fossils ($\psi$), on the other hand is not known. 
We will use an exponential prior on this parameter as well, and use a slide move to sample values from our distribution.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
psi ~ dnExponential(10) 
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(birth_rate, lambda=0.01, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(birth_rate, lambda=0.1, weight=3.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(birth_rate, lambda=1.0, weight=3.0)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Under the FBD model, the process is conditioned on the age of the origin, or the start of the process. 
We will specify a uniform distribution on the age of the origin. If you looked in the bears taxa file, you might notice that the age of the oldest fossil is slightly younger than the upper bound of the uniform distribution on the origin age. 
For this parameter, we will use a sliding window move. A sliding window move samples within an interval (defined by \cl{delta}). 
Sliding window moves can be tricky for small values, as the window may overlap zero. 
However, for parameters such as the origin, there is little risk of this being an issue.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
origin_time ~ dnUnif(37.0, 55.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvSlide(origin_time, delta=0.01, weight=10.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvSlide(origin_time, delta=0.1, weight=10.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvSlide(origin_time, delta=1, weight=10.0)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

All the parameters of the FBD process are now defined. 
The next step is to combine these parameters to define the tree prior as the FBD.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
tree_prior = dnFBDP(origin=origin_time, lambda=birth_rate, mu=death_rate, psi=psi, rho=rho, taxa=taxa)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Next, we will define the \cl{fbd\_tree} variable as a random variable. 
It will be used to generate trees under the FBD process that conform to our clade constraints. 

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
fbd_tree ~ dnConstrainedTopology(tree_prior, constraints) 
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Finally, we can also create deterministic nodes for other quantities we might be interested in monitoring. 
Below, we will define a monitor that prints the number of fossils that are inferred to be `sampled ancestors' - lineages that are present in the phylogeny, and have descendants present on the tree. 
We will also define a deterministic node for the age of the crown group of bears, using the previously-defined extant bear constraint (Section \ref{}).

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
sa := fbd_tree.numSampledAncestors();
crown := tmrca(fbd_tree, clade_extant)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

\subsection{The Uncorrelated Exponential Relaxed-Clock Model}\label{subsect:RB-ModelUCExp}

{\begin{framed}
Open your text editor and create the lineage-specific branch-rate model file called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{model\_UCExp\_TEFBD.Rev}}} in the \cl{scripts} directory.

\end{framed}}


\bigskip

\subsection{The General-Time Reversible Gamma-Rates Model of Sequence Evolution}\label{subsect:RB-ModelGTRG}

{\begin{framed}
Open your text editor and create the molecular substitution model file called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{model\_GTRG\_TEFBD.Rev}}} in the \cl{scripts} directory.

Enter the \Rev code provided in this section in the new model file.
\end{framed}}

\bigskip

\subsection{Modeling the Evolution of Binary Morphological Characters}\label{subsect:RB-ModelMorph}

{\begin{framed}
Open your text editor and create the morphological character model file called {\textcolor{red}{\cl{model\_Morph\_TEFBD.Rev}}} in the \cl{scripts} directory.

Enter the \Rev code provided in this section in the new model file.
\end{framed}}

As stated in the introduction, we will use a prior on state frequencies to relax the key assumption of the Mk model. 
Because we are working with binary data, we can use a discrete Beta distribution to describe the variation in stationary state frequencies across characters. 
The Beta distribution has two parameters, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ which describe its shape. 
For simplicity, we will assume that $\alpha$ = $\beta$. 
The below code draws a value for $\beta$ from an exponential distribution and places a move on it.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
beta_hp ~ dnExponential( 1.0 )

moves[mvi++] = mvScale(beta_hp, lambda=1,    weight=1.0 )
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(beta_hp, lambda=0.1,  weight=1.0 )
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(beta_hp, lambda=0.01, weight=1.0 )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Next, we'll create a vector containing four different site stationary state frequencies. 
This is similar to allowing gamma-distributed rate variation across sites. 
We will then use these stationary frequencies to generate a set of new Q-matrices which do not enforce the assumptions of the same transition rates at every site and equal forward and backwards transition rates.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
beta_cats := fnDiscretizeBeta( beta_hp, beta_hp, 4)
for(i in 1:beta_cats.size())
{
    Q_morpho[i] := fnFreeBinary(v(1-beta_cats[i], beta_cats[i]))
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}


As in the molecular data partition, we will allow gamma-dstributed rate heterogeneity among sites.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
alpha_morpho ~ dnExponential( 1.0 )
rates_morpho := fnDiscretizeGamma( alpha_morpho, alpha_morpho, 4, false )

moves[mvi++] = mvScale(alpha_morpho, lambda=0.01, weight=1.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(alpha_morpho, lambda=0.1,  weight=1.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(alpha_morpho, lambda=1,    weight=1.0)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Each data partition has to have a clock rate. For simplicity, we will assume a strict clock rate drawn from an exponential distribution.

{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
clock_morpho ~ dnExponential(1.0)

moves[mvi++] = mvScale(clock_morpho, lambda=0.01, weight=4.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(clock_morpho, lambda=0.1,  weight=4.0)
moves[mvi++] = mvScale(clock_morpho, lambda=1,    weight=4.0)
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

As in our molecular data partition, we now combine our data and our model. There are some unique aspects to doing this for morphology. \par
You will notice that we have a variable called `coding'. This variable allows us to condition on biases in the way the morphological data were collected.
This specifies the ascertainment bias correction discussed in \ref{subsubsection{Morphological Character Change}}. \par

We use the flag `siteMatrices=true' to indicate that we are providing multiple Q matrices generated as a function of our state frequency variation model. \par


{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
phyMorpho ~ dnPhyloCTMC(tree=fbd_tree, siteRates=rates_morpho, branchRates=clock_morpho, Q=Q_morpho, type="Standard", coding="variable", siteMatrices=true)

%TODO this they can do interactively in rb

Start up RevBayes at the command line. You should do this from within the \cl{RB\_TotalEvidenceDating\_FBD\_Tutorial} directory.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
./rb
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}

Read in the MCMC sample of trees from file.
{\tt \begin{snugshade*}
\begin{lstlisting}
trace = readTreeTrace("output/bears.trees")

for(i in 1:trace.size())
{
    trees[i] = fnPruneTree(trace.getTree(i), pruneTaxa=v(taxa[17],taxa[20]))
}

trace_pruned = treeTrace(trees)
mccTree(trace_pruned, "output/bears.mcc.tre" )
\end{lstlisting}
\end{snugshade*}}
